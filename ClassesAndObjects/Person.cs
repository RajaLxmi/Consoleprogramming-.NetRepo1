//object oriented programming has to do is - creating your own datatype it includes properties and methods we do that through the definition of class.


/* For example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has attributes, such as weight and color, and methods, such as drive and brake.
 *  A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
